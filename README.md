Introduction:

In the domain of Java software development, ensuring compatibility across different Java versions is crucial for the success of projects. Maven serves as a powerful tool for managing dependencies, automating builds, and facilitating continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This assignment aims to introduce you to Maven within the context of a Java project with specific dependencies, focusing on creating a flexible project object model (POM) file that supports compatibility across multiple Java versions. Through hands-on experience, you'll configure Maven to streamline the software development process and integrate it into a CI/CD pipeline while ensuring compatibility with Java versions 8, 11, 14, and 17.

Assignment Overview:

This assignment will guide you through the creation of a Maven-integrated Java project with specific dependencies, emphasizing the importance of a flexible POM file and compatibility across multiple Java versions. You'll explore Maven's capabilities in managing dependencies, automating builds, understanding the Maven build lifecycle, and ensuring seamless integration with CI/CD workflows. By the end, you'll be proficient in using Maven to manage dependencies, handle compatibility across different Java versions, orchestrate build cycles, and effectively manage CI/CD pipelines.

Assignment Objectives:

Create a Maven project with a flexible POM file capable of supporting compatibility across Java versions 8, 11, 14, and 17.
Manage specific dependencies within the POM file, ensuring compatibility across the specified Java versions.
Understand Maven's build lifecycle and execute commands to compile, test, package, and deploy the project.
Customize the build process using Maven plugins tailored to Java development and compatibility.
Integrate the Maven-based Java project into a CI/CD pipeline, automating builds, tests, and deployments.
Demonstrate proficiency in using Maven commands and utilities for project management, dependency resolution, understanding the Maven build lifecycle, and CI/CD integration.
Assignment Structure:

Creating a Maven Project with a Flexible POM File:

Initialize a new Maven project and configure the POM file.
Define properties and profiles within the POM file to manage compatibility across Java versions.
Managing Specific Dependencies and Java Version Compatibility:

Specify specific dependencies in the POM file, ensuring compatibility across Java versions 8, 11, 14, and 17.
Understanding the Maven Build Lifecycle:

Explore Maven's build lifecycle, including its various phases such as clean, validate, compile, test, package, verify, install, and deploy.
Understand the purpose and order of execution of each phase in the build lifecycle.
Maven Build Process Customization:

Customize the build process using Maven plugins, focusing on compatibility with different Java versions.
Configure plugins to perform additional tasks such as code quality checks, static analysis, and documentation generation.
Integrating Maven into CI/CD Pipeline:

Set up a CI/CD pipeline with Maven integration, using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
Configure automated build triggers, testing, and deployment stages while ensuring compatibility with target Java environments.
